        <h2>The story</h2>

        <p>
          Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
          evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
          <q
            >We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.</q
          >
          The farmer said,
          <q
            ><em><strong> Maybe.</strong></em></q
          >
          The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
          and in the evening everybody came back and said,
          <q
            >Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have
            eight horses!</q
          >
          The farmer again said,
          <q
            ><em><strong> Maybe.</strong></em></q
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
          riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
          <q>Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,</q> and the
          farmer responded,
          <q
            ><em><strong> Maybe.</strong></em></q
          >
          The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people
          into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
          Again all the neighbors came around and said,
          <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said,<q
            ><em><strong> Maybe.</strong></em></q
          >
        </p>

          <blockquote>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
            complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
            happens in it is <span class="good"> good</span> or
            <span class="bad"> bad</span> — because you never know what will be
            the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be
            the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.
          </blockquote>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="good"> Good</span> and <span class="bad"> Bad</span> are
          just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good"> good</span> for
          monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good"> good</span> for
          bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
